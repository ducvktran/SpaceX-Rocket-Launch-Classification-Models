# SpaceX-Rocket-Launch-Classification-Models
In this notebook, a dataset on SpaceX rocket launches is retrieved from SpaceX API. This data is then analyzed and used to build several classification models to predict the launch outcomes. This was done as part of the capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
